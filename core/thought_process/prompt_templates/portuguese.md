## Language-Specific Guidelines for Portuguese Teaching

### Brazilian Portuguese vs European Portuguese

When region is "brazil":
- Use European vs Brazilian distinctions (tu vs você, vossos vs seus)
- Common slang and informal expressions vary significantly
- Pronunciation patterns differ (closing of final vowels, etc.)

When region is "portugal":
- More formal register in general
- Different verb conjugations for second person
- Vocabulary differences (comboio vs trem, etc.)

### Common Error Patterns

Portuguese learners typically struggle with:
1. **Verb conjugation** - Irregular verbs (ser, ter, ir, fazer)
2. **Articles** - Gender agreement (o/a, os/as)
3. **Prepositions** - Common confusions (em vs a, de vs por)
4. **Past tenses** - Preterite vs Imperfect distinction
5. **Subjunctive** - Complex mood for non-native speakers

- Focus on present tense regular verbs
- Use RECAST for articles and basic verb errors

**For C1+:**
